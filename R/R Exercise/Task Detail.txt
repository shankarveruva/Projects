Details of task:  

The dataset you are to use can be found on the section 3. Assessment Resources. It is the cleaned and reformatted version of the dataset you used in the Programming Exercise 1. The dataset shows percentage (%) of coral bleaching for 8 sites and different types of coral in the Great Barrier Reef over the last 8 years. One thing to be noted is that not all sites have data for the entire period and not all corals are found at each site. The data is fictional.

In this assignment, you must demonstrate following competencies.

Reading the dataset into R.

Creating a static visualisation using ggplot2 that shows how the bleaching varies over the years for each type of coral and for each site. Your visualisation must satisfies the following aspects.

The visualisation uses faceting with each facet showing the bleaching for a type of coral at one site across the time period.

The sites should be ordered by latitude.

The visualisation shows line smoothing of the data.

Extending the static visualisation specified on point 2 into an interactive Shiny visualisation that allows users to choose the type of coral to be displayed and the choice of smoother.

Creating a map using Leaflet that shows the location of the sites.

Merging the map into your interactive Shiny visualisation. Use any kind of visual indicators (e.g. text label, shape, colour coding) to link the site on the map to the corresponding facet. You are not expected to create an interactive linking (i.e. clicking points on the map to change the visualisation, and vice versa). The visualisation and map can be independent but they have to be linked using any visual indicators mentioned earlier.
