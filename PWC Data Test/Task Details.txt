1. Road Accident Test - This test is essentially a "role play" exercise designed to simulate what a typical engagement could look like as a member of our Data Analytics team. In the data set you will receive, there are ~50,000 records - where a record is a single accident [ACCIDENT.csv]. The problem is loosely defined, but we expect you to analyse the data and come up with some real world hypothesis/policies/initiatives that they could use to  improve the road accident rate. You are free to use the software you are most comfortable with (Excel, Tableau, etc) to present your analysis. 


Hint: Not all tables/fields may be necessary and you may need to join the tables on key fields.
