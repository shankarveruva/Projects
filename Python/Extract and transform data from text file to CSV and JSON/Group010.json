Various processes, such as patterning the polysilicon, planarizing top layers of the structure, and the like can remove top portions of the dielectric layer, which can result in decreased control of gate height when a metal gate is formed in place of the dummy gate electrode, decreased control of fin height for finFETs, and the like. Increasing the resistance of the dielectric layer to attack from these processes, such as by implanting silicon or the like into the dielectric layer before such other processes are performed, results in less removal of the top surface, and hence improved control of the resulting structure dimensions and performance."},"USD0854625":{"patent_title":"Pinwheel","kind":"Design Patent","number_of_claims":1,"inventors":"[Karen Hendrickson-Santospago, Sara Casilio]","citations_applicant_count":3,"citations_examiner_count":21,"claims_text":"[The ornamental design for a pinwheel, as shown and described.]","abstract":"NA"},"US10361784":{"patent_title":"Remote radio apparatus and component thereof","kind":"Utility Patent Grant (with a published application) issued on or after January 2, 2001.","number_of_claims":10,"inventors":"[Xiaoming Shi, Xiaohui Shen, Dan Liang, Haigang Xiong, Haizheng Tang]","citations_applicant_count":11,"citations_examiner_count":3,"claims_text":"[1.

Also provided is a spatial-encoding scheme for a low-field, low-power consumption, light-weight, and easily transportable MRI system. In general, the portable MRI system spatially encodes images using spatial inhomogeneities in the polarizing magnetic field rather than using gradient fields. Thus, an inhomogeneous static field is used to polarize, readout, and encode an image of the object. To provide spatial encoding, the magnet is rotated around the object to generate a number of differently encoded measurements. An image is then reconstructed by solving for the object most consistent with the data."},"US10360638":{"patent_title":"Insurance claim capitation and predictive payment modeling","kind":"Utility Patent Grant (no published application) issued on or after January 2, 2001.","number_of_claims":20,"inventors":"[Randall Hanson, Robert H.

A computer-implemented method comprising:generating, by a computer system, a first list, the first list comprising a first label for a feature, a second label for a user selection associated with the feature, and a plurality of feature-selection pairs, each feature-selection pair of the plurality of feature-selection pairs defining a first association between the first label and the second label;generating, by the computer system, a second list, the second list comprising a third label for a result, a Uniform Resource Locator associated with the result, and a second association between the third label and a feature-selection pair of the plurality of feature-selection pairs;validating, by the computer system, the second list against the first list by identifying that the first association defined by each feature-selection pair in the second list is in the first list;after validating the second list against the first list, traverse, by the computer system, the first list to generate a plurality of user interface elements based at least in part on the validation; andgenerating, by the computer system, a user interface based at least in part on the first label for each feature in the first list, the second label for a user selection associated with each feature in the first list, and the third label for each result in the second list, the user interface comprising a plurality of features that each comprise the plurality of user interface elements, the first list and the second list generated independently from program code that is used for generating the user interface.,20. A system comprising:memory configured to store computer-executable instructions; andat least one processor configured to access the memory and execute the computer-executable instructions to collectively at least:generate a first list, the first list comprising a first label for a feature, a second label for a user selection associated with the feature, and a plurality of feature-selection pairs, each feature-selection pair of the plurality of feature-selection pairs defining a first association between the first label and the second label;generate a second list, the second list comprising a third label for a result, a Uniform Resource Locator associated with the result, and a second association between the third label and a feature-selection pair of the plurality of feature-selection pairs;validate the second list against the first list by identifying that the first association defined by each feature-selection pair in the second list is in the first list;after validating the second list against the first list, traverse the first list to generate a plurality of user interface elements based at least in part on the validation; andgenerate a user interface based at least in part on the first label for each feature in the first list, the second label for a user selection associated with each feature in the first list, and the third label for each result in the second list, the user interface comprising a plurality of features that each comprise the plurality of user interface elements, the first list and the second list generated independently from program code that is used for generating the user interface.]","abstract":"Embodiments of the present invention provide a faceted browser for decision-making that enables interactive visualization of a decision space as choices are made. According to one embodiment, a computer-implemented method comprises receiving a selection of a first choice from a user. The first choice is displayed in a user interface that includes a plurality of facets, each facet including a plurality of choices. The method further comprises disabling at least one second choice in response to the selection of the first choice, and determining a first result set in response to the selection of the first choice. The user interface is then updated in real-time to display the selected status of the first choice, the disabled status of the second choice, and the first result set to the user."}}
